# Node.js & Express.js (Backend Fundamentals)

This section is focused on the **backend journey** — building scalable applications using Node.js and Express.js. It captures both core module understanding and practical Express app development.

> **Goal**: Get comfortable with building real APIs, handling middleware, managing environments, and creating backend-ready logic flows.

---

## 📌 Topics Included

- 📦 **Node.js Core Modules** (`fs`, `path`, `events`, `http`, `os`)
- 🛣️ **Express.js Essentials** (Routing, Middleware, Body Parsers)
- 🔐 **Environment Config & `.env` Usage**
- 🔄 **Async Handling in APIs**
- 📄 **File Upload, Download, Stream Logic**
- 🔗 **RESTful API Patterns & Modular Folder Structure**

---

## 📁 Structure

Each module includes:
- **What it is**
- **How it works**
- **Code Demo**
- **Where it's used in production**

## 🚀 Why This Exists

Backend isn't just about routes — it's about **architecture, flow, and confidence** under pressure. This repo helps build that layer by layer.

> “You can’t scale what you don’t understand. Node + Express = the new backend muscle.”
